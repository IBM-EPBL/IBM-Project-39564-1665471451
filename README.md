<h3> PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>Using Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cutting-edge technology
 like cloud technology, smart farming has significantly changed the way that 
farming is done .Data analytics, technology, and fog computing. It permits
farmers.to be informed about the farm in real time and assist them in making shrewd and well-informed choices. In this essay, we suggest a Model based on Distributed Data Flow (DDF) for smart farming an application made up of interconnected modules. We two deployments are used to assess the proposed application paradigm. fog-based and cloud-based approaches, depending on the application modules are installed in the cloud and fog data centre respectively. We contrast the fog- and cloud-based. Using Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cutting-edge technology like cloud technology, smart farming has significantly changed the way that farming is done. We contrast the fog- and cloud-based approach for network use and endto-end latency. The application of modern IOT technology in agricultural areas has been intensively investigated and the subject of innumerable exploits. IoT for agriculture, however, must be viewed from a different perspective than it is for other industries like industrial and logistics. This report demonstrates IoT-based agricultural production for supply chain stabilisation, all requirements for agricultural production at the time of environmental sensor development, a system for predicting crop maturity, and the amount spent on crop production after gathering all the necessary environmental data. One of the biggest areas for IoT innovation is precision agriculture, a discipline that employs analytical metrics to optimise farming operations. Enhanced crop yields are now more important than ever for global food security. This crop production maximisation is made possible by cloud-connected, wireless technology, which automate routine agricultural chores and provide real-time monitoring for daily intelligent decision-making. To assist farmers in analysis and for better management of the agricultural field, from companies own various GPS connections, monitors, and controls. Most of the food and farming sectors would adopt expanded production once the organic business becomes more well-known in order to acquire effective and affordable pesticide substitutes. Numerous sons of the soil are capable of detecting leaks, measuring moisture, and effectively managing energy use with the aid of implanted wireless devices and other automated electronic systems. It is essential to pay close attention to all large-scale 
Solutions.</p>
